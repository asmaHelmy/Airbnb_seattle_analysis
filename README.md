# Airbnb seattle data case study:

An analysis of the Airbnb Seattle Data.

## In this notebook I explored these three questions:

1. What's the cheapest month to do so?
2. Are the prices related with the number of available listings?
3. Do cheaper listings have lower ratings or not necessarily?

## Results:

- January is the cheapest month to visit Seattle.
- There are no enough evidence that the prices and the number of available listings are correlated.
- It's not necessarily that cheaper listings have lower ratings.
